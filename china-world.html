            </div>

            <div class="col-md-9">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>I created a brand identity for China World in order to successfully grow their
                business in Metro Vancouver by sustaining and expanding their customer base with a team of five people during a 4 month project. We conducted ethnographic studies and proposed several concepts to help create a brand identity for China World. The main tasks I took on in this project were creating the user journey maps, conducting ethnographic research, and helping with the proposal of our design concepts. We used Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch during this project.</p>
                
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>We started the project by conducting ethnographic research into China World. This included going to the store in person to observe how the store operates and actually shopping at the store to see what the customer experience was like. We also interviewed the owners of the store to gain insight on what the owners' point of view was and how they thought the store could improve. Based on the research and information collected, we created three different personas shown in Figure 1 and a set of user journey maps shown in Figure 2 to better understand the problem. </p>
                
                <h3>Personas</h3>
                <div class="process-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/portfolio/personas.png" alt="Personas">
                        <figcaption class="fig-padding">Figure 1: Three personas we created.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>There were three main takeaways from the personas we created:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Their customers' needs align with China World's goals.</li>
                <li>Their customers' values align with China World's values.</li>
                <li>There is potential to cater to a variety of customers.</li></ol>
                
                <h3>Problem: Design Focus</h3>
                <p>One of the problems we ran into early in the process was narrowing in on a design focus. Many of our initial ideas were focusing on how to improve the in-store experience, but we did not account for the initial touchpoint customers have when seeing China World for the first time. This initial touchpoint determines whether or not customers will continue browsing items at China World. After switching our design focus to creating a stronger brand identity for China World, we were able to propose concepts that not only improved the in-store experience, but also the initial touchpoint customers have with China World. </p>
                
                
                <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>
                <div class="process-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/portfolio/Journeymaps-combined.png" alt="Journey Maps">
                        <figcaption class="fig-padding">Figure 2: Journey maps of store discovery and store visit.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>The key takeaways from the user journey maps we created were:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>They had no digital presence (website or social media).</li>
                <li>The only advertisement was in a Chinese-only newspaper.</li>
                <li>The company has two names: 'China World' and 'Rice World'.</li>
                <li>Unclear which locations carry which products, as both carry different products.</li>
                <li>Signage is very hard to read (yellow text on white background) and the majority of it is in Chinese.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Rice Packaging</h3>
                <p>Based on the key takeaways from our user journey maps and our revised design focus, we proposed several new rice packaging concepts for China World. One of the big issues we addressed with the new packaging was inviting new customers to try and explore different kinds of rice. By offering smaller sizes of rice, customers will be more likely to try different kinds of rice because of the lesser commitment compared to a 20lb bag.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Food Labelling</h3>
                <p>Our new rice packaging concept can be applied to other areas of the store such as the labelling on products like meats and seafood.</p>
                <div class="process-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/portfolio/labels.png" alt="Labeling concept">

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <h3>Store Signage</h3>
                <p>This new brand identity can be even further applied to other areas of the store such as banners, aisle names, price tags, and divider bars.</p>
                <div class="process-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/portfolio/signage.png" alt="Labeling concept">
                        <figcaption>Figure 5: Store signage concept. </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <h3>Digital Strategy</h3>
                <p>We also proposed a digital strategy using social media. This allows China World to reach a larger audience via online advertisements. They can announce sales and exclusive offers on these platforms, increasing their following and reach. This will also legitimize the business, as they will now have a proper website and locations available on Google and other digital platforms. </p>
                <div class="process-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/portfolio/instagram.png" alt="Instagram concept">

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                <p>One of the main things I took away from this project was that you should always listen to what your client is telling you, but to never believe what they tell you; sometimes what the client wants is not what they actually need. In this case, our client said they simply needed a website to help grow their business, but they did not think of the initial touchpoint a customer has with the company. It is highly unlikely a customer will stumble upon their website by chance. Our proposal created an initial touchpoint that draws customers in and retains them by differentiating themselves from their competitors.</p>
