                <h4 class="subhead">Improving the UX design of a location-based AR mapping application at Nextech AR Solutions.</h4>

            </div>

            <div class="col-md-9">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As the lead designer on this project, I worked closely with developers and product managers to initially help redesign a mobile AR mapping app in 4 weeks. The improvements I made to the visual design and overall user experience has helped launch the app into beta with hundreds of beta testers. As we continued to work on this app, over the course of 3 additional months, I helped design an AR navigation feature which has become the core functionality of the app. Deals with sporting venues, trade shows, and malls are being worked on to bring ARway to their customers and spaces.</p>
                
                <h3>What is ARway?</h3>
                <p>ARway is an augmented reality app that enables the creation of immersive virtual experiences, including turn-by-turn indoor navigation. It can help people find their seats at a stadium or find specific items at a department store. Diverse multimedia content such as audio files, images, and videos can be virtually placed to enhance user engagement within the augmented reality environment. This provides an immersive platform to transform how individuals explore, navigate, and interact within their space.</p>
                

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>The initial scope of this project was to give a visual uplift to the app. There were several developers working on this app and design was not a priority prior to me joining the team. This is what the app looked like before I worked on it:</p> 
                
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>Figure 1: The original ARitize Maps user interface. (Yes, the homepage was a gray screen)</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>Constraints</h3>
                <p>Coming onto the project, it was clear that the app needed a visual uplift, however I needed to understand more about the app and the target audience. I had meetings with product managers and stakeholders to gather requirements and to determine what constraints were on the project.</p>
                
                <h4>Time Constraint</h4>
                <p>The app was being launched for beta in less than two months and I was originally given two weeks (eventually became four weeks) to redesign the app to allow for development time and QA testing.</p> 


                <h4>Team Constraint</h4>
                <p>There were a total of four designers in the company and I was the only designer working with the ARitize Maps team. In addition, we didn’t have any researchers on the team so I took on research in addition to design.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Working within these constraints, I started researching other AR mapping apps. I knew there wasn’t much time to do research, so I conducted a competitive analysis of various different mapping apps like Apple/Google Maps and non-mapping related AR apps such as Adobe Aero. This helped my understanding of common problems that AR mapping applications have and informed my design decisions as I was working on this app.</p>

                    </figure>
                

                
                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>Initial research focused on better understanding user’s needs related to creating AR experiences as well as exploring other indoor navigation solutions on the market.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>What other AR products exist focusing creating virtual experiences?</li>
                    <li>How do people interact with existing products?</li>
                    <li>What are the current pain points with existing products?</li>
                    <li>Which features are essential to creating AR experiences?</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Competitive analysis was conducted to identify competitor's strengths and weaknesses to inform ARway's features and information structure.</p>

                <h3>Persona</h3>
                <p>From the research conducted, we found that there was an opportunity to provide an indoor navigation system using ARway. I created a persona to help better understand the user we were designing for, including their goals, motivations, and pain points. </p>
                    <figure>
                <img src="img/portfolio/persona.png" alt="Persona" class="img-responsive" />
                    </figure>

                <h3>Userflow</h3>
                <p>To kick-off the design process, I created a user-flow to help generate ideas and establish which elements were necessary for each screen. Basic wireframes were then created for feedback.</p>
                    <figure>
                <img src="img/portfolio/Userflow.png" alt="Userflow" class="img-responsive" />
                        <figcaption>Figure 4: Userflow showing the steps to create a map.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                
                <p>I created initial wireframes of the homepage to get feedback on. This was a particularly important page to receive feedback on because the original homepage was an empty gray screen. Initially, these wireframes showed the user’s own maps in a list view, but this quickly changed because users who don’t create maps and guest users would have an empty home page. Further iterations included a dashboard, featured maps, and nearby maps to create a smoother experience when searching for a specific map to view.</p>
                <div class="process-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/portfolio/LowFi.png" alt="Homepage wireframes.">
                        <figcaption class="fig-padding">Figure 5: Wireframes of the homepage.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
            <p>I also designed several iterations of the mapping experience. This was a complex problem to solve as there were several requirements to accurately map an environment: lighting conditions, mapping speed, capturing enough feature points, and many more factors. I researched different recording apps and found the panorama feature in cameras to be a strong design pattern to incorporate in the mapping experience.</p>

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>There were additional features such as navigation and Holograms (another Nextech product) that could be added into AR spaces. These features were important to have for larger use-cases such as retail stores, trade shows, and events. </p>

                <h3>Compass vs Turn-by-turn Navigation</h3>
                <p>From the research conducted, we found that there were two different types of navigation that customers wanted and we designed for both use-cases. Some customers enjoy naturally discovering places of interest while going to their destination. For example, they might want to look and browse different products and sections on the way to their destination. For these customers, there's a compass-style navigation where ARway points to the direction the customer will want to head towards, but won't provide a turn-by-turn route. Other customers simply want the quickest route to the destination and don't want to browse. We designed a turn-by-turn navigation option to provide these customers with the quickest route to their destination. </p>

                <img src="img/portfolio/NavigationStyles.png" alt="Navigation Styles" class="img-responsive" />
                        <figcaption>Figure 9: Compass style vs turn-by-turn navigation.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Accessibility was an important aspect we kept in mind when designing the navigation feature. There's often different areas such as staircases or escalators that can be inaccessible for many people. Without wheelchair accessible routes, people who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids may encounter barriers such as stairs, narrow doorways, and inaccessible elevators. This can not only make it difficult for them to shop or move around the space but also pose safety risks. ARway has several accessibility options to help people with mobility impairments navigate safely to their destination. </p>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                
                
                <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
                <p>ARway was received well by beta testers and there are deals with larger clients and malls being worked on. There are still several things I would want to improve on the app. I would like to conduct user tests with real users to receive direct feedback and iterate the design. Due to the time constraints, there was no time to recruit participants and run these studies during the project. The mapping process in particular could benefit greatly from user testing to see what works and what doesn’t work. Different users and scenarios could be tested to improve the overall experience of the app. </p>
