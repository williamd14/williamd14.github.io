                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>I worked on a brief set by Barclays and the D&AD New Blood Awards with two other designers. The goal of the project was to propose a solution for Barclays to help banking customers with mental health issues better manage their money. We derived insights from our research and scoped in on credit cards and financial literacy in particular. Our solution was an informative starter package that came with Barclaycard in the mail to better inform customers about how their credit card works. I was responsible for conducting research and deriving insights to drive the project forward.</p>
                
 
                <h3>Research</h3>
                
                <p>We started the project off by conducting preliminary research on the topic of mental health and how it was related to finance. It was important for us to understand what types of problems people suffering from mental health issues face and how they dealt with them. I compiled secondary research from podcasts, studies, and academic journals in addition to our own primary research from conducting in-person interviews with people who struggle with their finances. This can be seen below in Figure 1. </p>

                </div>
                
                <h3>Insights</h3>
                <p>We derived three key insights based on our research:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Financial decision making can be influenced by anxiety, lack of knowledge, and resource availability.</li>
                <li>Anxiety can often be caused by long-term financial aspects, not just day-to-day issues.</li>
                <li>People don’t know where and are often embarrassed to seek financial help.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>These insights helped us scope in specifically on reducing stress and anxiety levels caused by high levels of credit card debt.</p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                
                <p>Our final solution consisted of an informative starter package that comes with the customer’s Barclaycard in the mail shown below in Figure 2.</p> 
                
                <div class="process-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/portfolio/welcome-package.png" alt="Mockups of our redesigned welcome package.">
                        <figcaption class="fig-padding">Figure 2: Mockups of our redesigned welcome package.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                
                    
                    <p>The starter package would replace the <a class="in-text-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18H427wv3n1_9K1RdeeBHMPSzipgbLgiy/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">traditional packaging</a>that would accompany a credit card in the mail.
                    The goal of our starter package is to educate and inform first-time credit card users about key concepts they may not fully understand. I helped simplify the language being used and presented the information with more visuals and less text. For example, we explained concepts such as minimum monthly payments using a real example with a graph where it would take years to pay off credit card debt if only the minimum monthly payment was being paid. By informing and educating people about credit card concepts, they will be less likely to go into credit card debt, resulting in fewer people becoming stressed/anxious about their finances.</p>
                
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                
                <p>The key takeaway from this project for me was connecting the insights we derived from our research and connecting it back to the original problem. Although it was clear to my team and I that we were tackling stress and anxiety caused by high levels of credit card debt, we were not explicit enough about this fact when proposing our solution. This led to some confusion about how our solution linked back to the brief, especially during our concept presentation. By being more explicit about how our insights relate back to the original problem, our team could have created a stronger argument for our concept.</p>
