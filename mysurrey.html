            <div class="col-md-9">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>I worked on a brief set by the City of Surrey with two other designers. The problem we were tasked with was engaging its under 19 population with the local government’s services and programs. We derived three insights from our research which helped us scope in on providing a redesigned volunteer hub that is of interest to Surrey students in Grades 10 - 12. Our final solution was an extension of the MySurrey web application offered by the City of Surrey.</p>
                
                                <p>The full case study can be found<a class="in-text-link" href="MySurrey-Case-Study.pdf"target="_blank"> here.</a> </p>
                <p>The prototype can be found <a class="in-text-link" href=" https://xd.adobe.com/view/e70bc865-437a-40fa-5c9a-c702d72574c6-913a/"target="_blank"> here.</a></p>
                
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>We conducted primary research through interviews and surveys for this project. We had two surveys posted on the Simon Fraser University subreddit and the Surrey subreddit asking about people’s experiences with their city services. This was useful for us to understand people’s perception of city services and how they use (or don’t use) some city services. Many of the respondents said there are no services the city offers that cater to them. I also personally conducted an interview with a high school student from Vancouver. It was insightful to get a high school student’s thoughts and feelings about engaging with city services.</p> 
                
                <p>Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, it was difficult to find primary sources for our research. We did not have easy access to high school students in Surrey. Some of our data was based on our own experiences in school and current high school students from Vancouver and Burnaby.</p>
                
                <h3>Insights</h3>
                <p>We used an affinity diagram shown below in Figure 1 and derived three key insights based on our research:</p>
                <div class="process-images">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/portfolio/AffinityResearchDiagram.png" alt="Affinity Diagram">
                        <figcaption class="fig-padding">Figure 1: The affinity diagram based on our initial research.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <ol>
                <li>The content of the promotional information is too broad and lacks a target audience. The information is not reaching Surrey’s Youth because the majority of it is not of interest to them.</li>
                <li>Youth are most interested in services such as recreational activities and events, many of them wanted to volunteer and not necessarily participate themselves. </li>
                <li>There are too many services being offered that aren’t catered towards what Surrey Youth are looking for, so they tend to ignore the services in general, even though some would be beneficial or interesting to them.</li></ol>
                
                <h3>Reframing the Problem</h3>
                <p>These insights helped us scope in specifically on providing a service that is of interest to Surrey High School students because it meets the need of fulfilling their volunteering requirements. We reframed the problem using it how might we statement:</p>
                
                <h4>How might we engage with secondary school students regarding volunteer opportunities to help them complete their 30 hours of volunteer experience? </h4>
                
                
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Our <a class="in-text-link" href=" https://xd.adobe.com/view/e70bc865-437a-40fa-5c9a-c702d72574c6-913a/"target="_blank">final solution</a>was an extension of the MySurrey web application that offers a volunteering section that consolidates opportunities from the City of Surrey and their partners. A mockup of this can be found below in Figure 2.</p>

                </div>


                <p>The MySurrey Volunteering Hub offers an onboarding process for new users, volunteering history to track hours, and several filters to help users search for the right volunteer opportunities for them. I worked on designing the detailed volunteer opportunity page shown in Figure 3 below, as well as prototyping the interactions between pages. I also wrote copy for some of the pages and the final design document explaining our rationale behind our design decisions. </p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>A key takeaway from this project for me was working within the client’s constraints. Our team’s original idea was to create a new app and offer volunteer services from there. However, the City of Surrey does not have the budget or resources to build a completely new app for volunteering. Although this was a school project, we wanted to design a product that could be feasibly implemented upon completion. We changed our direction and focused on building our solution on top of an existing product or service the City of Surrey already offers.</p>
